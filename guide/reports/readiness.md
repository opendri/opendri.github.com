# Readiness Report

## Open Government Data

1. Context: Policies and Laws
	1. **Executive Authority on Open Data**: what legal authorities or policies have been created by executive action? How are ministries implementing that order?
	2. **Legislative Authority on Open Data**: what legal authorities or policies have been created by legislative action? How are ministries implementing these laws?
	3. **Judicial Authority/Rulings around Open Data**: what court/judicial rulings mediate the use of open data, including issues of privacy, cybersecurity, and information security? How are ministries implementing these legal findings?
	4. **Regulations (operationalization of laws)**: what procedures have ministries put into place to implement open data?
	5. **Policies (intentions of leaderships)**: are there specific policies around open data, particularly as it concerns disaster risk management?

2. Risk Data Catalogue
	1. **Platform**: how does the government and other players in DRM collate and track data about the DRM cycle?
	2. **Metadata Standards**: what methods do experts use to find the data they need? what metadata standards are in place for major components of the risk assessment process: exposure data, hazard data, vulnerability data, and risk? How are these metadata used by major players to find information?
	3. **Data Standards**: what data standards are in use, particularly around GIS, hazards, exposure, and risk?
	
3. Risk Data
	1. **Building Data**: key municipal buildings as well as polygons and attributes about residential and commercial structures.
	2. **Infrastructure Data**: what critical infrastructure and municipal buildings have been mapped? To what level of detail? What is the vintage of the data?
	3. **Hazard Data**: What data exist for each hazard that the countries faces, including hazards which have not recurred for centuries? Which ministries own which data sets? 
	4. **Exposure Data**: 
	5. **Vulnerability Data**: 
	6. **Risk/Impact Data**: 
	7. **Quality Assessment**:
