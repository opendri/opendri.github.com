# Nepal

## Context
In early 2012, the World Bank's South Asia Region (SAR) engaged in the project with Nepal's Ministries of Education and Health to retrofit schools and health facilities against seismic risks in the Kathmandu valley. The prioritization of this investment required knowing both where these facilities were located and the relative exposure of these structures to earthquakes. When the teams could locate a comprehensive list of schools or health facilities to begin their risk assessment, they turned to the GFDRR team that was working on OpenDRI.

## Scoping
Through a series of meetings, GFDRR introduced SAR and the GoN to the work that OpenStreetMap had done in Indonesia under AIFDR as well as the OSM efforts in the Kotse Valley with the American Red Cross. Based on the need to collect high-resolution data about more than 10,000 buildings in Kathmandu, SAR and the GoN worked with GDRR to fund an OpenStreetMap effort to map every school and health clinic in Kathmandu. In the process, SAR and GFDRR agreed to create the first site in a new OpenCities Project, where open data and efforts like OpenStreetMap would be used to catalyze better urban planning.

The team clarified the use case:
