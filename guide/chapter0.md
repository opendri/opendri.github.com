# 1.	Preface

OpenDRI started from a shared problem: how to help people in vulnerable regions better understand the risks they face from natural hazards. It is rare for the leaders in these communities and national governments to have the data they need to see the invisible: the exposure of their built environment to hazards, the vulnerability of those structures to particular stresses that these hazards may generate, and the effect that the failure of this infrastructure will have on residents of these impact zones and their ways of life. 

Without data, they cannot make different choices. They cannot prepare for expected failures or make reasonable (often low-cost) investments in mitigating risks. They cannot pass building codes and zoning restrictions that create resilience in the face of expected adversity. They cannot compare their historical understandings of a risk (inherited with the wisdom of their society) with new understandings of a dynamic planet, where climate risks are changing historical understandings and opening societies to hazards that they have not previously faced.

That said, having data is not enough to create changes to behavior. To alter mental model of the risks across a population, the data needs to be available to everyone. It needs to be open--**legally open**, in terms of intellectual property licenses that permit it to be reused, repurposes, and redistributed without cost, as well as **technically open**, so that any software can open it, manipulate it, and save new analyses in open formats. More importantly, the data needs to be collected, analyzed, and curated by the people in the place facing the risks. Only through this process of having the data be available to all and curated by those who are potentially affected can behavior fully change.

Open Data for Resilience is a partnership of governments and international institutions that are building a deeper understanding of risk by sharing information about their exposure, vulnerabilities, and risk models.  This guide outlines practices that an ecosystem of peers is developing. All of the partners to this guide are working to build better data around the disaster risk management (DRM) cycle. Science agencies are developing better models of earthquakes, floods, droughts, tsunamis, volcanoes, and other hazards. Governments are cataloguing the exposure of their built environments to those hazards, at the same time that they are exploring the vulnerability of their populations to the direct effects of hazards and the indirect effects of changes to the built and social environments. And donors are looking at how best to help their clients target investments. 


## Who is the Guide for?
This guide is for those who wish to apply the open scientific method to developed a deeper understanding of the shared challenges of targeting investments in disaster risk management.

## Goals of the Guide
This guide intends to:

1.	Outline DRM activities that have harnessed open data
2.	Explore shared challenges in using open data to increase resilience of societies who are facing high risks from natural hazards
3.	Create the first draft of a growing consensus around how to implement open data initiatives inside of client governments
4.	Provide a map of the work processes, partnerships, tools, and practices around OpenDRI
5.	Collate shared documents that can be used as templates for future implementations of OpenDRI.

## Style for the Guide
The guide is written in short snippets. This approach allows for several dynamics:

1. Easy Reading
2. Simplified Translation
3. Multiple Layouts: A3, A4, A5, and web.
4. Easy reference in the form of a growing body of knowledge

## Collective Intelligence around Open for Resilience
The intention of this guide is to make the work itself a collective effort. It is seeded from the experience of a handful of partners, and given as a gift to the communities that are working in open data. Curators will continue to steward the content, ensuring that added knowledge reflects the community's shared experiences.

<!-- ## What problems does this approach address? -->

## Risk Management
(src: Improving the Assessment of Disaster Risks to Strengthen Financial Resilience)
### Risk Identification
Risk assessments and risk communication

### Risk Reduction
Structural and non-structural measures (infrastructure, land use planning, policies, and regulation
)
### Financial Protection
Assessing and reducing contingent liabilities (budget appropriation and execution; ex-ante and ex-post financial instruments)

### Preparedness
Early warning systems, support of emergency measures, contingency planning

### Post-Disaster Reconstruction
Resilience recovery and reconstruction policies, ex-ante-design of institutional structures

## Shock and Surge
Shock in system is causing less human casualties and more financial losses, often a significant proportion of GDP. Shock of disaster causes need for liquidity. There is something here which is accelerating the flow of funds to the right, or driving a flow outward of funds and then a suction for funds on the left side.
