## Background/General Description

Through several World Bank and other international efforts in recent years, a variety of studies have been conducted to better understand *country's* vulnerability to natural hazards and the effects of climate change, as well as the status of its natural resources on which the majority of rural livelihoods and the economy rely.  As part of these studies, important datasets related to vulnerability, impacts, climate change, disaster risk reduction and preparedness have been collected and created.  All too often this data has not been widely distributed or made available to the Government of *country* or other important actors involved in building resilience in the country. 

The World Bank is partnering with the Government of *country* to strengthen the capacity of its technical agencies to carry out (country DRM context). Several Technical Assistance Projects (TAPs) are planned to assess (list of hazards) risk in selected strategic locations of the country. The first TAP is already designed in collaboration with a number of key ministries and development partners. It is anticipated that a significant amount of spatial data will need to be collected or created over the course of these projects.

In partnership with the World Bank's Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI), the *country* National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) and the (international partner) have decided to launch a number of online platforms to help ensure that the data created by a number of past or ongoing projects so that this information remains accessible and useful to the Government of *country*, key development partners, and the public.

The initial phase of this effort will take place between *start date* and *end date*.  It will result in the creation of several web-based data sharing tools, managed by the staff of the (NDMA and international partners) and key partners.  This platform will be based on the free and open-source software, GeoNode, which is being used in a number of other OpenDRI projects in the region and around the world. http://geonode.org/

The activity will also provide support to relevant actors within government ministries and other partners on the use of OpenStreetMap for participatory data collection as well as the SAFE suite of decision-support tools (see http://innasafe.org).

The objective of this activity is to establish the platform and to provide the necessary technical support and training to (*partners*) and partner institutions to carry the initiative through the first phase.  

## Duties and Accountabilities

* **GeoNode Training**:  Conduct a series of formal trainings to (*NDMA*), (*international partner*), and other core partners of the *country* OpenDRI program.
* **Data collection, styling, and uploading**: Assist (*NDMA*) and (*international partner*) teams with initial population of GeoNodes as necessary, including upload of data and metadata, styling of individual layers, and the creation of basic suites of custom maps using the tool.
