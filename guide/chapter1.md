# 1.	Introduction: The Need for Disaster Risk Reduction Data
Actors in the disaster risk management cycle are struggling to harness new sources of data and analysis. From disaster risk reduction and preparedness to response and recovery, open data has a place in both parts of the DRM cycle, but focus on this guide is on DRR. 

## A shared problem: the need for high-resolution data to target DRR activities
Outline the core problem around exposure data.

1.	Hazard Data
2.	Exposure Data
3.	Vulnerability Data

Targeting DRR investments requires better exposure data

## Case Study
Kathmandu Pre-OpenDRI: the need for basic map of schools and health facilities. Why we could not model seismic risks to critical infrastructure except at the macro level.

## Why Open Data?
Concept: empower decision makers with open systems. Create shared space where community can assembled around shared problems and develop open solutions. 

## Principles
Operating principles of open data.

1.	Legally versus Technically Open
2.	Accessible: available at a public address (URI)
3.	Interoperable: open standard
4.	Reusable: can be redistributed and reused in ways that were not necessarily anticipated by the curator of the original data.

Overall, the intent is to follow Huffman’s First Principle of Information Sharing: 
Leave data better than you found it.

## Challenges
Open data is not easy to implement. There are many reasons why 
1.	Fragmentation
2.	Incompleteness
3.	Inaccuracy
4.	Transparency: politics of opening data creates visibility into processes that have not previously been transparent. Such exposure creates anxieties.
5.	Trust

## Value of Open Data
Yet, open data creates new opportunities
1.	Fusion of previously fragmented data
2.	Greater coverage and comprehensive views
3.	Community curation to correct data
4.	Trust in transparent processes
5.	Inexpensive and reusable
