### Building the first data catalogue (GeoNode)
The first installation of a GeoNode unfolds in several ways. 

* **Self-Installation**: There may be a government champion with sufficient technical skill that he or she can install the software and configure it with minimal outside assistance. In some cases, this work can happen with Skype support. 
* **Consultant Installation**. The GeoNode can be installed by local or ex-patriot consultants.
* **GFDRR Installation**. The GeoNode can be installed by GFDRR staff.

#### Team
In general, across all three deployment options, there are at least three roles that need to be filled:

* **ToR: System admin**. A person competent in Linux or the operating system on which other GIS software (e.g., ESRI ArcServer) is installed. He or she must be capable of installing sometimes complicated software.
* **ToR: Data Curator**. A person capable of negotiating the release of data from partner ministries, who can cleanse and prepare data for release to the public.

In some cases, GeoNode installations may require the services of a part-time STC who can assist in the customization of the GeoNode:

* **ToR: GeoNode Consultant**. A person who can develop the data catalogue in GeoNode, including the front-end customized to the context.

#### Technical Infrastructure
The technical requirements for a GeoNode installation are being developed in a [GFDRR Installation Guide](geonode.html). The System Administrator will be responsible for:

* Server(s): Configuring the technical platform on which the data catalogue will be hosted.
* Domain Name: obtaining a domain name and negotiating its use with various partners.
* System Configuration: installing necessary software and configuring it for use on the Web.
