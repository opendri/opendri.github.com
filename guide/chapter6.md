# 6. Scaling
Expanding program to new cities, expanding the partnership, validating the work, 

***
## 1. Open Government Data
After early adopters have added data, the slow process of building an ecosystem of users begins. This work focuses on meeting the use cases of partners, building relationships with gatekeepers to other data sets, and locating islands of data which may be considered core to DRM, but may be held outside of government (often survey or GIS firms).

### Creating Linked Data and federated network of data catalogues
GeoNodes can be linked into a federation of nodes, where each node serves the data of the hosting organization and pulls in live data from other nodes in the network. From the perspective of an analysis or government official, the data exists as endpoints--URIs that can be added as a layer in GIS or risk modeling software. 

TBD: building the network of geonodes.

### Building Policies to manage interlinked OGD
When ministries begin sharing data that has previously been closed, policy and legal question often arise. Some of these concern access and privacy. Do the data reveal information about citizens that needs to be kept private? How can the data be released for DRM purposes in ways that protect citizen privacy? 

Other times, data might need to standardized, so that the cost of moving it from ministry to ministry are minimized and outside partners can also use the data. These standards often revolve around two areas: metadata (finability) and data formats.

#### Metadata standards
TBD: explanation of metadata and importance for findability.

#### Data Formats
TBD: explanation of data formats OpenDRI commonly finds and discussion of open data formats.

### Building Curation capacity and QA/M&amp;E



### Visualizing OGD
