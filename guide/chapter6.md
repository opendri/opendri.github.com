# 6. Scaling
Expanding program to new cities, expanding the partnership, validating the work, 

***
## 1. Open Government Data
After early adopters have added data, the slow process of building an ecosystem of users begins. The sign for this work to start is if a champion has loaded data and a user base begins to use the data catalogue. The usage indicates that the pilot happened in a fertile environment for additional work. 

This work focuses on meeting the use cases of partners, building relationships with gatekeepers to other data sets, and locating islands of data which may be considered core to DRM, but may be held outside of government (often survey or GIS firms).

### Creating Linked Data and federated network of data catalogues
GeoNodes can be linked into a federation of nodes, where each node serves the data of the hosting organization and pulls in live data from other nodes in the network. From the perspective of an analysis or government official, the data exists as endpoints--URIs that can be added as a layer in GIS or risk modeling software. 

TBD: building the network of geonodes.

### Building Policies to manage interlinked OGD
When ministries begin sharing data that has previously been closed, policy and legal question often arise. Some of these concern access and privacy. Do the data reveal information about citizens that needs to be kept private? How can the data be released for DRM purposes in ways that protect citizen privacy? 

Other times, data might need to standardized, so that the cost of moving it from ministry to ministry are minimized and outside partners can also use the data. These standards often revolve around two areas: metadata (finability) and data formats.

#### Metadata standards
TBD: explanation of metadata and importance for findability.

#### Data Formats
TBD: explanation of data formats OpenDRI commonly finds and discussion of open data formats.

Notes Positive effects on growth

1. Disasters catalyze investment
2. Funding handoffs between international institutions (new funding)
3. new TORs approved (adding OSM, another network
4. Training programs
5. Expanding the number of people who use spatial data in an ecosystem
6. Network building: get old GFDRR Labs TORs on "regional technical networks of expertise". How does one keep these networks healthy? Ask Biswha and Brad.

Negative effects on growth

1. Low data use: when few people use data every day
2. Informal networks: cabal of small number of people have extant informal mechanisms to obtain risk data. That said, they like training...
3. Data decay rate: how fast it goes out of date (Currency Fade Rate). Examples?
4. Utility of some data also fades over time (Utility Fade Rate). Examples?
