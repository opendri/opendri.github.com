# 1.	Preface



OpenDRI started from a shared problem: how to build higher-resolution data around the exposure and vulnerability of societies to natural hazards, so that client governments could better target investments in DRR. This guide outlines practices that are growing with an ecosystem of peers, all of whom are working on various pieces of the puzzle. Science agencies are developing better models of earthquakes, floods, droughts, tsunamis, volcanoes, and other hazards. Governments are cataloguing the exposure of their built environments to those hazards, at the same time that they are exploring the vulnerability of their populations to the direct effects of hazards and the indirect effects of changes to the built and social environments. And donors are looking at how best to help their clients target investments. 

## Who is the Guide for?
This guide is for those who wish to apply the open scientific method to our shared challenges in targeting DRR investments.

## Goals of the Guide
This guide intends to:

1.	Outline DRR activities that have harnessed open data
2.	Explore shared challenges in using open data to increase resilience of societies who are facing high risks from natural hazards
3.	Create the first draft of a growing consensus around how to implement open data initiatives inside of client governments
4.	Provide a map of the work processes, partnerships, tools, and practices around OpenDRI
5.	Collate shared documents that can be used as templates for future implementations of OpenDRI.
