# 5.	Piloting

<h4>Phase Summary</h4>

</ul> 
</div>

Turning the design into the first pilot often takes 1-6 months of work. The team will spend time building consensus and writing concept notes and terms of reference often requires several organizations (and several departments within those organizations) to come to agreement and release funding. Once funding flows, however, work in the field can lead to relatively fast outputs.

The piloting phase builds the first instances of a data catalogue, collects the first participatory mapping data, and (context permitting) allows government officials to apply the new data to initial impact models of known hazards.

## 1. Open Government Data

The OpenDRI team identifies consultants to partner with client on a campaign to collect, co-map, cleanse, and analyze new data around the DRM cycle. These consultants prepare existing data for release.

### Building the first data catalogue (GeoNode)
The first installation of a GeoNode unfolds in several ways. 

* **Self-Installation**: There may be a government champion with sufficient technical skill that he or she can install the software and configure it with minimal outside assistance. In some cases, this work can happen with Skype support. 
* **Consultant Installation**. The GeoNode can be installed by local or ex-patriot consultants, particularly in contexts where 
* **GFDRR Installation**. The GeoNode can be installed by GFDRR staff.

Technical platform, support, training to system administrators, preparation of the environment to receive data.

### Collating Geo-Data
Collating the right data is the key to keeping the project focused on solving problems around the DRM cycle. OpenDRI data for the GeoNode needs to be:

1. GeoData: it needs to have geographic attributes that describe some aspect of the human systems and built environment and the hazards that may affect people and infrastructure.
2. Open Format: Data must be compliant with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards
3. Reusable: the data must be licensed so that it can be redistributed and turned into derived works that reuse the original data.

#### Explain the Use Case
Lobbying for the release of information requires having a clear use case that officials can understand and contribute to. 

#### Be prepared for less than fully open
Open data may require protections. It may need to have copyrights, acknowledgements, and/or restricted access to make it open. In the early stages of open data, it may be necessary to have some data be available to a limited part of the larger ecosystem.

#### Invest in release of data rather than perfection of data
A lesson learned from previous engagements is that it is possible to spend inordinate amount of time preparing small percentage of the data, instead of aggregating data. Government officials may have a very rational fear of releasing bad data. Their jobs may be on the line. That said, from the perspective the open data effort, it may be better to flag data as needing helping and moving through larger volume than working on specific data and spending consulting hours on big changes to small data sets. OpenDRI Pilot Team staff need to be prepared to balance the need for accuracy with the need for comprehensive releases of data around the DRM cycle.

#### Core Mapping Data
Streets, buildings

##### Imagery
An imagery archive allows for analysis over time. If the archive includes imagery from recent pre- and post-disaster contexts, it may permit analysis of the effectiveness of certain types of interventions. Where possible, imagery should be made available with metadata to describe what the imagery shows.

##### Maps
Mapping data may vary widely in quality and vintage. It is important to get recent data into the GeoNode, less so than an archive. 

##### Streets and Critical Infrastructure
Vector data about the streets and major logistics routes are critical during emergencies. Modeling how they would be affected by hazards is a core feature of OpenDRI. These data are needed to make those models.

##### Building Footprint Data
Building footprint data is the basis for making almost all exposure, vulnerability, and risk models. That said, this data may be protected for various reasons, including potential market value, agreements with private firms, and privacy laws. When available, building footprint data may also have issues with resolution, project, accuracy, and vintage. Building attributes (such as number of stories and building materials) are not always present in the data, but a critical for making accurate models. 

#### Hazard Maps
To make models of exposure, vulnerability, and risk, analysts require information about local hazards. The OpenDRI team should hunt for data that describes: 

##### Floods and Tsunami
For water (hydromet), the resolution topology of the region under analysis becomes critically important. In many parts of the world, the best available digital elevation model (DEM) may be 10 *meters* in resolution. In flat river valleys where altitude changes very slowly, flood inundation models with 10m DEMs could show water flowing uphill--a physically impossible result. As a result, it is crucial to assess DEMs available for hydromet analysis.

##### Earthquakes
Seismic maps and models that show fault lines, project shakemaps for various epicenters. The GEM may provide the best available data.

##### Cyclone Maps
Cyclones are hard to predict, but patterns of cyclonic activity tend to follow pathways over time. (ref for cyclone data?)

##### Landslide
Landslide data can be hard to obtain or difficult to get released due to perceptions of commercial value. (research what is needed)

##### Droughts
(will we include droughts?)

#### Other GIS data
TBD...

### Assessing Data Quality and License Assessment
Assessment of the quality of data in the new GeoNode Map the gaps of current exposure data. Find other efforts to map exposure data (case study: Kathmandu). Is there no data, or are licensing/revenue issues preventing the flow of data? What are the costs of this stasis? (if price is preventing action on mitigation, what are the potential losses versus the potential revenues?)

## Outputs and Metrics


## Misalignment of NDMAs and World Bank
NDMA are a primary partner on OpenDRI--GFDRR's counterpart. And yet, National Disaster Management Agencies only do disaster response (though that is changing somewhat in a few countries). The World Bank is prohibited from doing disaster response. NDMAs tend to be data consumers, not producers. Often do emergency preparedness, but not often risk modeling. Where is the right place in a government to put risk modeling?
