# 5.	Piloting
Turning the design into the first pilot often takes 1-6 months of work. Building consensus and writing concept notes and terms of reference often requires several organizations (and several departments within those organizations) to come to agreement and release funding. Once funding flows, however, work in the field can lead to relatively fast outputs.

The OpenDRI team identifies consultants to partner with client on a campaign to collect, co-map, cleanse, and analyze new data around the DRM cycle. These consultants prepare existing data for release. Work includes:

* Top-Down Collation of Data from government an other partners into a common data catalogue. 
* Bottom-up Collection of Exposure Data through community mapping
* Deployment of an Impact Modeling Tool, the first step towards risk modeling.

## 1. Open Government Data

### Building the first data catalogue (GeoNode)
The first geonode

Description of the pilot of the first GeoNode. 

Technical platform, support, training to system administrators, preparation of the environment to receive data.

#### Technical Infrastructure

#### Team
ToR: Data Curator.
ToR: System admin.
Tor: GeoNode. Have one for Haiti. Model (created year ago, reflects learning).

### Collating Geo-Data
Collation, cleansing of data.

Open data may require protections. It may need to have copyrights, acknowledgements, restricted access to make it open.

(sidebar the dangers of data munging. May spend inordinate amount of time preparing small percentage of the data, instead of aggregating data. Fear of releasing bad data. May be better to flag data as needing helping and moving through larger volume than working on specific data and spending consulting hours on big changes to small data sets).

#### Core Mapping Data
Streets, buildings

##### Street Data

##### Building Footprint Data
Issues with resolution, project, accuracy, vintage. Often attributes are not present in the data.

#### Critical Infrastructure Layers

#### Hazard Maps

##### Floods and Tsunami
For water (hydromet), the resolution topology of the region under analysis becomes critically important. In many parts of the world, the best available digital elevation model (DEM) may be 10 *meters* in resolution. In flat river valleys where altitude changes very slowly, flood inundation models with 10m DEMs could show water flowing uphill--a physically impossible result. As a result, it is crucial to assess DEMs available for hydromet analysis.

##### Earthquakes

##### Cyclone Maps

##### Droughts

##### Landslide

#### Imagery

#### Other GIS data

### Assessing Data Quality and License Assessment
Assessment of the quality of data in the new GeoNode Map the gaps of current exposure data. Find other efforts to map exposure data (case study: Kathmandu). Is there no data, or are licensing/revenue issues preventing the flow of data? What are the costs of this stasis? (if price is preventing action on mitigation, what are the potential losses versus the potential revenues?)

### Activating the Open Risk Data Working Group.
Description of how to convene the the working group

### Release of the GeoNode for Public Use
How to release a GeoNode for public use. Engagement. Bug Fixes.

## 2. Community Mapping of Exposure Data
The pilot of the first community mapping engagement in one or more neighborhoods or cities. To pull from OpenCities Toolkit.

### Contracting Incubation Space
How to engage the logistics company in the creation of the first incubation space or the use of an existing space for OpenDRI.

### Equipment
Computers, GPS units, software, etc. Contract vehicles for equipment may not exist, may need to be handled locally.

### Training Program
OSM and OpenDRI training. Exposure Data: a how to from NSET. What does a training program look like?

### Field Surveys/Mapping Parties
How to hold the first mapping parties. From OpenCities Toolkit.

### Data Quality Assessment: Coverage, Accuracy, reviews with team


### Troubleshooting: politics, perception


***

## 3. Initial Impact Modeling
1. Hazard Data Coordination
2. Moving from hazard modeling to impact modeling
3. Training how to think in terms of risk
4. InaSAFE deployment
5. COP for modelers
6. customized training program by science organizations

***

## Backend (Behind the Scenes) Management Processes

### Project Management
Stewarding the new data collection, existing data release, and training in the use and curation of the data.

### Government Coordination
Ensuring alignment and planning for co-development/release of data.

### Linkages
Connecting ecosystem of partners together and institutionalizing practices.

### Quality Assurance 
Performing ongoing review of data as it is collected and commissioning studies from local universities and experts to gauge the accuracy of data.

## Outputs and Metrics


## Misalignment of NDMAs and World Bank
NDMA are a primary partner on OpenDRI--GFDRR's counterpart. And yet, National Disaster Management Agencies only do disaster response (though that is changing somewhat in a few countries). The World Bank is prohibited from doing disaster response. NDMAs tend to be data consumers, not producers. Often do emergency preparedness, but not often risk modeling. Where is the right place in a government to put risk modeling?
