Turning the design into the first pilot often takes 1-6 months of work. The Design team will spend time building consensus among the partners, writing concept notes and terms of reference that require several organizations (and several departments within those organizations) to come to agreement and release funding. Once funding flows, however, work in the field can lead to relatively fast outputs.

The piloting phase builds the first instances of a data catalogue, collects the first participatory mapping data, and convenes the Open Data Working Group to review policy issues around the new data.

## Objectives
The primary objective of a pilot is to open the imagination of the partners to what is possible when they share data about risk. The pilot provides a tangible use case to focus the efforts of multiple organizations on building the various parts of an open data ecosystem, some of which may be inside of government, some of which may be fully public. In some cases, the pilot provides in impetus to get over "last mile" problems, where partners have already made great strides towards building risk data but are prevented from launching their work by a mix of problems that often were discovered only by engaging with the task.

## What and Why
Taking the idea of open data from theory to practice requires a facilitating partner to toggle between the processes working from bottom-up and the top-down. 

### Bottom Up

#### Install platforms for data collection
The first step in each OpenDRI engagement has been to create a place where data can be shared. This space is meant to be neutral: a place where the data is legally and technically open for use by all (or at least those who have access to it). In a few cases, this space has solely been OpenStreetMap. In most cases, client ministries wish to have a data catalogue where they can upload datasets that are meant to be opened. The [process for building these data catalogues](datacatalogue.html) is described in the Methods section.

#### Demonstrate feasibility of collecting and opening data

#### Probe the quality of the data and make corrections to training

### Top Down

#### Review Data with Open Data Working Group

#### Create analytical products that show value of new data and expose gaps

#### Expand the network by mobilize champions and training new data collectors and curators
Creating linkages.

## Who

### Open Data Working Group

### Community Mapping Efforts

### Data Curators

### Management Team

The Pilot Management Team often includes three expert consultants:

* **OpenDRI Lead**: an expert manager of the integration of various tactics into a comprehensive strategy around DRM data collection and curation.
* **Community Mapping Lead**: an expert in the implementation of community mapping methods for the collection of exposure data.
* **Open Data Catalogue Specialist**: an expert in the technical mechanisms of collecting and cleansing data from government ministries and community mapping efforts into a comprehensive data catalogue. This expert will have skills to train local officials in the deployment of an OpenGeo GeoNode or the use of existing ESRI GeoPortal as data catalogue.

## Outputs

## Outputs and Metrics
The pilot produces data and grow community. As a result, its output metrics center on these two issues.

### Data
* Coverage/Extent: what percent of the country's risk areas are reflected in the data sets?
* Vintage: how new is the data across the coverage of the country?

### Community
* Surveyors: how are the number of surveyors scaling over time? What turnover exists?
* Outputs: what is the productivity of the surveyors over time? What is the quality of that effort?
* Social Network: what is the shape and vector of the social network? Who are the supernodes? How many new nodes?

## Case: Nepal: Pilot of Kathmandu.

## Context
In early 2012, the World Bank's South Asia Region (SAR) engaged in the project with Nepal's Ministries of Education and Health to retrofit schools and health facilities against seismic risks in the Kathmandu valley. The prioritization of this investment required knowing both where these facilities were located and the relative exposure of these structures to earthquakes. When the teams could locate a comprehensive list of schools or health facilities to begin their risk assessment, they turned to the GFDRR team that was working on OpenDRI.

## Scoping
Through a series of meetings, GFDRR introduced SAR and the GoN to the work that OpenStreetMap had done in Indonesia under AIFDR as well as the OSM efforts in the Kotse Valley with the American Red Cross. Based on the need to collect high-resolution data about more than 10,000 buildings in Kathmandu, SAR and the GoN worked with GDRR to fund an OpenStreetMap effort to map every school and health clinic in Kathmandu. In the process, SAR and GFDRR agreed to create the first site in a new OpenCities Project, where open data and efforts like OpenStreetMap would be used to catalyze better urban planning.

## Design
(will write prose around final form of the chapter)

### Key Personnel and Partnerships
* Three consultants: PM (Robert), OSM Consultant (Nama), KM (Ryan)
* NSET for structural engineering. 
* University for students. 
* Biruwa for incubation space.

### Community Mapping/Field Data Collection
* started without a list of schools
* 13 interns plus 350 active volunteer mappers.
* divided city into 4 quadrants. Used mapmyschool.org along with questions in each neighborhood to locate schools and health facilities not on any list.
* collected data (show graph of progress from reports)
* created linkages: NSET, USAID, ICIMOD. OpenDataDay. 

### Data Quality
In first three months, collected over 65,000 building footprints with over 350 active mappers. Required checking for accuracy.

#### NSET
NSET reviewed a sampling of small percentage of the buildings surveyed by the volunteers. They flagged issues to adjust training, and then provided that training to volunteers. It helped to taking pictures of every building along the way, enabling engineers to review both photos and forms.

#### UCL
Similar to UGM study from Indonesia, worked with Muki Hakley, who gave advice to the Geomatics Dept on Kath Univ on assessment of geometry of data and fitness of use. Reviewed the accuracy of building footprints, road networks (where roads overlap.

### Demonstrated Capacity
Data collected by mappers demonstrated the potential for open data to GoN as well as USAID. (get more)
