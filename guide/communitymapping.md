## Donor Addendum
It may be in the interests of government donors to catalyze and support community efforts around their development objectives, particularly mandates around mitigating vulnerable communites' exposure to natural hazards. Community mapping provides:

* Increased resolution about the nature of the risks and their location.
* Capacity to involve the host nation's scientific community and ministries in training about the identification and mitigation of risks based on data that the host nation can curate.
* Capacity to link DO with the investments of international organizations such as the World Bank, and potential partnerships to increase the leverage of government donor funding.
