# 3. Scoping
Deciding where and when to implement a OpenDRI project depends on a range of factors. OpenDRI initiatives work best in environments where a set of partners are ready for the challenge of collecting, assessing, and curating data about their built environment. Assessing the readiness of this environment requires a scoping mission (site visit) 

## Scoping Mission
<div class="info-box image-right adapted width-200px">
<h4>Principles</h4>
<p><strong>OpenDRI starts by listening</strong></p>
</div>
Mission must assess three aspects:

* **Top-down**: What factors will drive or constrain the release and integration of existing data that is fragmented across ministries and the organizations that are supporting the ministries or managing their own operations around DRM?
* **Bottom-up**: what factors will drive and constrain the collection of new data and the curation of those data by the communities that the data describes?
* **Use Case**: how ready is the client to apply the data to probabilistic risk modeling?

(stub) GFDRR is developing a diagnostic tool to aid in understanding the readiness of a client country for OpenDRI.

## Objective

### Determine the Fit
Client ministries and the offices of international organizations at the regional and country levels set strategic objectives that may include risk assessment, disaster preparedness, mitigation, post-disaster needs assessment (PDNA), and recovery. OpenDRI can fit into each part of the DRM cycle. For the World Bank, regional DRM leads will need to determine if and how an OpenDRI project fit into broader DRM agenda. 

The first step in determining if OpenDRI fits into strategic intent is to listen. Listen to the potential partners and the problems they are having managing risks from natural hazards. Where do they want to start? What politics and constraints are they facing and why? 

### Define the Use Case
Mobilizing collective action requires some goal--problem, use case, or other organizing principle--to focus effort and create a practical, tangible outcome. The objective of the scoping mission is to uncover potential use cases that could mobilize action around open data, both initially as well as in the long term. ( ... )

## Assess Government Support/Constraints
Are ministries selling data that are core to risk assessment: satellite imagery, maps, demographic data, cadastral data, hydro-met data, etc? What support is there for opening this data? Are there legal constraints or regulatory issues? Privacy issues? If so, are there ways to work through those issues and lawyers/legal advisors who are willing to build solutions instead of putting up roadblocks? ( ... )

Listen to problems government and other local leaders are having around managing risk. These might include
* existing use of Probabilistic Risk Modeling 
* Data being used for risk modeling and decisions
* Geospatial information systems

<h4>Key questions about open data</h4>
<ul>
<li>Are government ministries selling data? If so, to whom and what kind of revenue are the data generating? Is the sale price of datasets for DRM de minimus?</li>
<li>Who are the early adopters who are willing to share data? Why?</li>
</ul>

## Survey the Ecosystem

### Existing OSM Community
What is the state of the existing OSM community and its leaders? What does the map look like? What are their strengths and constraints? How would capacity building change the OSM community?

### Universities
Which universities have a geomatics or GIS department? Which have civil/structural engineering? (...)

### CSOs
What CSOs exist in the areas which need to be mapped? What capacities do they have?

### Incubators/Tech Community
Is there a logical place to host OpenDRI? What incubators exist and how well connected are they with the tech community?

## Identify Champions
Ministries and GIS companies may already have champions who understand open data and/or have been mapping the infrastructure of their country on their own time. Finding these individuals is a matter of networking, sometimes via surfing the data sets, sometimes by asking interesting questions of people on the scoping mission. Universities are a good place to start (...)

It is common to find a champion who understands the need for better risk analysis, but who lacks the human resources to turn the vision into reality. It is also common to find under-resourced ministry officials who need a cookbook for meeting mandates that would be too costly to pursue through traditional means (like hiring a survey firm to map a large city). Sometimes, ministries will wish to protect their mandates and want to control work in risk analysis. Each case will require a tailored approach. 

## Survey Data Sets
While donors may not fund the collection duplicative datasets (at least not intentionally), entities in country may collect data which already exists. This may happen for a variety of reasons: licensing of existing data may not allow for reuse or derivative works, no one may know of the existence of the data, the data may be of poor quality, etc. The scoping mission should try to find data sets that already exist within government. (note on snowball technique, reference to USAID report on Nepal mission, duplication of open space and building footprint datasets.)

## Inquire into Funding
What funding exists within the international community to support OpenDRI? Who has invested in DRR/DRM activities and at what funding level? 

GFDRR will be building a basic [Cost Structures](budget.html) document to outline costs based on previous experiences.
