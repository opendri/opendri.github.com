# 3. Intake
Deciding where and when to implement a OpenDRI project depends on a range of factors. OpenDRI initiatives work best in environments where a set of partners are ready for the challenge of collecting, assessing, and curating data about the built environment. 

( Fragment )
* Top-down: Release and integration of existing data that is fragmented across organizations, ministries, or data sources.
* Bottom-up: Collection of new data, curated by communities that the data describes.

## Objective
In general, the primary goal of OpenDRI project is to develop a deeper understanding of risks from natural hazards in a region or city. This goal usually has three parts:

* *Aggregation of existing risk data into a public data catalogue*. Data about the exposure of a nation to natural hazards are often fragmented across multiple institutions, often under policies that hinder the aggregation of those data into more comprehensive models. GIS and DMS platforms that enable this kind of aggregation are also rare and (until recently) were very expensive.

* *Collection of new risk data*. In many places, there exist no geospatial database of the built infrastructure that aggregates key attributes about its vintage, construction materials, height, or elevation. OpenDRI works with communities to build this asset database from the bottom-up using low-cost participatory mapping techniques, where collection and curation of the data is done by the communities that those data describe.

* *Fusion and Analysis of all risk data into models that drive investment in DRM*.

### Determine the Fit
Client ministries and the offices of international organizations at the regional and country levels set strategic objectives that may include risk assessment, disaster preparedness, mitigation, post-disaster needs assessment (PDNA), and recovery. OpenDRI can fit into each part of the DRM cycle. For the World Bank, regional DRM leads will need to determine if and how an OpenDRI project fit into broader DRM agenda. 

The first step in determining if OpenDRI fits into strategic intent is to listen. Listen to the potential partners and the problems they are having managing risks from natural hazards. Where do they want to start? What politics and constraints are they facing and why? 

It is common to find a champion who understands the need for better risk analysis, but who lacks the human resources to turn the vision into reality. It is also common to find under-resourced ministry officials who need a cookbook for meeting mandates that would be too costly to pursue through traditional means (like hiring a survey firm to map a large city). Sometimes, ministries will wish to protect their mandates and want to control work in risk analysis. Each case will require a tailored approach. 

### Define the Use Case
OpenDRI requires a specific use case. 

### Assess Support
Is there government buy in to opening data?

### Inquire into Funding
Is there funding for an OpenDRI program? What are the cost structures for an OpenDRI program?
