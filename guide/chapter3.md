# 3. Scoping
Deciding where and when to implement a OpenDRI project depends on a range of factors. OpenDRI initiatives work best in environments where a set of partners are ready for the challenge of collecting, assessing, and curating data about their built environment. Assessing the readiness of this environment requires a scoping mission (site visit) 

## Scoping Mission
**OpenDRI starts by listening**. 

Mission must assess three aspects:

* Top-down: What factors will drive or constrain the release and integration of existing data that is fragmented across organizations, ministries, or data sources?
* Bottom-up: what factors will drive and constrain the collection of new data and the curation of those data by ythe communities that the data describes?
* Use Case: how ready is the client to apply the data to probabilistic risk modeling?

GFDRR is developing a diagnostic tool to 

## Objective

### Determine the Fit
Client ministries and the offices of international organizations at the regional and country levels set strategic objectives that may include risk assessment, disaster preparedness, mitigation, post-disaster needs assessment (PDNA), and recovery. OpenDRI can fit into each part of the DRM cycle. For the World Bank, regional DRM leads will need to determine if and how an OpenDRI project fit into broader DRM agenda. 

The first step in determining if OpenDRI fits into strategic intent is to listen. Listen to the potential partners and the problems they are having managing risks from natural hazards. Where do they want to start? What politics and constraints are they facing and why? 

It is common to find a champion who understands the need for better risk analysis, but who lacks the human resources to turn the vision into reality. It is also common to find under-resourced ministry officials who need a cookbook for meeting mandates that would be too costly to pursue through traditional means (like hiring a survey firm to map a large city). Sometimes, ministries will wish to protect their mandates and want to control work in risk analysis. Each case will require a tailored approach. 

### Define the Use Case
OpenDRI requires a specific use case. 

### Assess Support
Is there government buy in to opening data?

### Inquire into Funding
Is there funding for an OpenDRI program? What are the cost structures for an OpenDRI program? 





## Team Composition
The team that scopes an OpenDRI deployment is generally composed of three types of individuals:

### GFDRR/International OpenDRI Advisor(s)
The 

### Local (Regional/Country) OpenDRI Advisor(s)

### Local Champion(s)



## Process
Listen to problems government and other local leaders are having around managing risk. These might include
* existing use of Probabilistic Risk Modeling 
* Data being used for risk modeling and decisions
* Geospatial information systems
*

#### Open Data Situation
1. Are government ministries selling data? If so, to whom and what kind of revenue are the data generating? Is the sale price of datasets for DRM de minimus?

2. Who are the early adopters who are willing to share data? Why?
