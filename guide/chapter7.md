Sustaining OpenDRI initiatives is a new problem. All current projects remain funded through their pilot or scaling funding plans. None have built self-sustaining revenue streams. That said, several dynamics are creating living ecosystems around open data for resilience:

**Use cases**: The immediate usefulness of data and data platforms to problems in the country are the most important attributes for success of OpenDRI. While there are risk models that capture more of the complexity of the modeling process (e.g., CAPRA), these tools are build for experts. Most decision makers lack the technical training to use these tools. Hence, tools like InaSAFE are an emerging method of building "risk communication tools" alongside "risk modeling tools."

**Academic Partnerships**: building GIS into curricula or creating training programs in local universities has proven an effective mechanism for instilling risk thinking into the current and upcoming generation of managers and government officials. Open data becomes a platform for the work in the class and builds a common understanding among multiple communities. This is particularly important for those that feed graduates into positions in local, provincial, and national government.

**Living Labs**. Building a community of users around social ventures, startups, and non-profits creates an ecosystem of users and developers who need mapping data and disaster data. Via Living Labs, projects are sustained over periods of time and incubated in a place with expert advice.
