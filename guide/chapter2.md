# 2.	Open Data for Resilience

Open Data for Resilience (OpenDRI) builds the capacity of nations to collate and collect the data necessary for impact and risk modeling. An OpenDRI project will generally combine three elements: 

1. **Collation of Open Government Risk Data (OGRD) and publication in an open geodata catalogue**. Data about the exposure of a nation to natural hazards are often fragmented across multiple institutions, often under policies that hinder the aggregation of those data into more comprehensive models. GIS and DMS platforms that enable this kind of aggregation are also rare and (until recently) were very expensive.

2. **Collection of Exposure Data with Participatory Mapping**. In many places, there exist no geospatial database of the built infrastructure that aggregates key attributes about its vintage, construction materials, height, or elevation. OpenDRI works with communities to build this asset database from the bottom-up using low-cost participatory mapping techniques, where collection and curation of the data is done by the communities that those data describe.

3. **Impact modeling of probable hazards on the built environment**. Fusion and Analysis of all risk data into models that drive investment in DRM.

OpenDRI also relies on parallel but separate efforts around improving the modeling of natural hazards, including weather forecasting and mid-term meteorological/climate forecasting. 

To build risk assessment capacity, governments need to collate existing data, integration information currently spread across ministries, provincial and municipal governments into a comprehensive whole. Given the rate of urbanization and changes to landscape, they must also build the capacity to rapidly update maps on a continual basis. The most cost effective means for accomplishing this goal is through participatory mapping, where local communities curate their own maps. 

OpenDRI starts with a client governments's problems and develops a work plan that combines risk assessment, open government data, and participatory mapping into a custom solution.

## History
OpenDRI began from a difficult problem: how to make risk data available to decision makers from national leaders to heads of small businesses and households.

## Problem to be solved

Hazard
Exposure
Vulnerability
Impact Modeling/Risk Communication
Risk Models

Collective action. Urbanization: Open Cities. How to use collective action to build data necessary for understanding risk, then build system to curate the data.

## Work Process Overview
Like open data initiatives, OpenDRI starts small and scales virally. It deploys in one city, and then another, expanding in utility as the amount of data increases, driving more pilots in more cities. As such, OpenDRI is not a linear process, but rather a cycle that iterates across cities (Ex: Pedang, then Jakarta, then west coast of Indonesia. Columbo then Batticloa).

## Partners
OpenDRI is a partnership. Starts from communities in which it gets implemented. Part bottom-up, part top-down.
OpenDRI starts as a partnership. Connect Bank, AusAID, GeoScience Australia with counterparts in the Governments of Indonesia, Philippines, etc. (emphasize the multidisciplinary aspects, as it emerges in the Design phase in the composition of the team for the scoping mission.)

What does the whole OpenDRI ecosystem look like and how does it work at the macro level?

## Principles

### Start small and scale
The value of a network is a function of the square of the nodes in the network--a function of the number of potential relationships. Similarly, the value of open data appears to be an exponential function of the number of people using it. Open data efforts tend to start small and scale exponentially. Indonesia. From a few thousand buildings mapped by x people to million buildings with y contributors.
