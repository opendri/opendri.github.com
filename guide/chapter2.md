# 2.	Open Data for Resilience

Open Data for Resilience (OpenDRI) builds the capacity of nations to collate and collect the data necessary for impact and risk modeling. Among the several intended impacts is improved targeting of investments for mitigating the effects of disasters. An OpenDRI project offers a menu of DRM tactics for building high-resolution exposure data with collective action, including:

1. **Collation of Open Government Risk Data (OGRD) and publication in an open geodata catalogue**. Data about the exposure of a nation to natural hazards are often fragmented across multiple institutions, often under policies that hinder the aggregation of those data into more comprehensive models. GIS and DMS platforms that enable this kind of aggregation are also rare and (until recently) were very expensive.

2. **Collection of Exposure Data with Participatory Mapping**. In many places, there exist no geospatial database of the built infrastructure that aggregates key attributes about its vintage, construction materials, height, or elevation. OpenDRI works with communities to build this asset database from the bottom-up using low-cost participatory mapping techniques, where collection and curation of the data is done by the communities that those data describe.

3. **Risk Communication via Impact modeling**. By combining data about hazards, exposure, and vulnerabilities into a simple impact model, OpenDRI can help government officials see the effects of probably futures and understand how to apply the data to thinking differently about disaster preparation, mitigation, and recovery.

OpenDRI also relies on parallel but separate efforts around improving the modeling of natural hazards, including weather forecasting and mid-term meteorological/climate forecasting. It also relies on cross-support from peers in risk assessment and modeling, who can take data curation that is at the core of OpenDRI and turn that information resource into actionable recommendations around risk management. **Note**: Risk Assessment is not part of OpenDRI.

## History
OpenDRI began from catastrophe. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti killed many of the staff of the national mapping agency (CNIGS) and destroyed a growing knowledge of the geography of Haiti. The building collapse also buried servers with the sole copies of geographic data that would have aided the response and recovery to one of the biggest humanitarian disasters of the last century. Then something unexpected happened.

Several satellite companies collected fresh high-resolution imagery of the damage and made the data available for free. The World Bank collected imagery via aircraft at even higher resolution. More than 600 volunteers of the OpenStreetMap community started tracing the imagery, creating a highly detailed map of Haiti. Volunteers made about 1.2 million edits to the map, performing an estimate year of cartographic work in about 20 days--all for no cost. This effort catalyzed rethinking of community mapping and open data within the World Bank.  

A question emerged: if community mapping could map most of a country in a crisis, what could be done before a disaster? Could GFDRR invest in collecting better data about the exposure of the built environment to natural hazards as a form of technical assistance? Could the communities then curate this data, creating the opportunity for better spatial and temporal resolution of the exposure of a country to threats?

A second set of question emerged a few months later. When the famine of 2010 hit the Horn of Africa, GFDRR convened a meeting where partners to the response agreed to share their operational data using a shared data catalogue. This effort&mdash;[Open Data for the Horn](http://horn.rcmrd.org/)&mdash;

<h4>Defining Open</h4>

<p>Open data are “a piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it — subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.” </p>

<p>Open-source software is a piece of software whose “source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design. Open source code is typically created as a collaborative effort in which programmers improve upon the code and share the changes within the community. Open source sprouted in the technological community as a response to proprietary software owned by corporations.”  </p>

<p>Open standards/formats for data provide a free and openly available specification for “storing digital data, usually maintained by a standards organization, which can therefore be used and implemented by anyone. For example, an open format can be implementable by both proprietary and free and open source software, using the typical software licenses used by each.” </p>

## Work Process Overview
Like open data initiatives, OpenDRI starts small and scales virally. It deploys in one site, and then another, expanding in utility as the amount of data increases. As such, OpenDRI is not a linear process, but rather a cycle that iterates across cities (Ex: Pedang, then Jakarta, then west coast of Indonesia. Columbo then Batticloa).

5.	Sustaining

## Partners
OpenDRI is a partnership. Starts from communities in which it gets implemented. Part bottom-up, part top-down.
OpenDRI starts as a partnership. Connect Bank, AusAID, GeoScience Australia with counterparts in the Governments of Indonesia, Philippines, etc. (emphasize the multidisciplinary aspects, as it emerges in the Design phase in the composition of the team for the scoping mission.)

### 1. Open Government Risk Data
Open Government Risk Data (OGRD) programs provide for the strategic release of certain government datasets to the commons, where they can be curated, emended, amended, and (most importantly) reused in ways that governments alone cannot do. OGD is **not** the release of all government data to the public.

The strategic release of data to a public commons enables first recommendation from NHUD: 

<blockquote class="quote-icon">
<p>First, governments can and should make information more easily accessible. People are often guided in their prevention decisions by information on hazards, yet the seemingly simple act of collecting and providing information is sometimes a struggle. While some countries attempt to collect and archive their hazard data, efforts are generally inconsistent or insufficient. Specifically, there are no universal standards for archiving environmental parameters for defining hazards and related data. Data exchange, hazard analysis, and hazard mapping thus become difficult.</p>
</blockquote>

Open data empower decision makers at all levels of government, as well as in the private sector. Open data creates a common space where community can assembled around shared problems and co-develop solutions with a wide range of partners.

#### Principles
For data to serve decision makers across a society, it needs to be fully open. This means:

1.	Technically Open: Many government datasets are locked in data formats that can only be read by proprietary software (and sometimes hardware, like obsolete magnetic tape backup drives). The data must be released in ways that allow any device or software can read it.
2. Legally Open: the license under which the data is released must permit redistribution and reuse.
2.	Accessible: the data must be available at a public Internet address (URI)
3.	Interoperable: the data must follow open standards.
4.	Reusable: can be redistributed and reused in ways that were not necessarily anticipated by the curator of the original data.

#### How OpenDRI works with Governments
OpenDRI advises ministries how on the collation, cleansing, and release of data related to risks. These datasets tend to be spread across governments. Sometimes, ministries sell them to each other (though the revenues tend to be low and the administrative costs for managing these sales tend to be high). OpenDRI partners work together to determine which data are appropriate for release. That said, rather than following the traditional method of aggregating data into a central web portal, OpenDRI recognizes that ministries wish to retain stewardship over their own data. So OpenDRI recommends that each ministry release its data using (free and open source) platforms that allow other ministries to subscribe to the data using web services. This model has a number of benefits:

1. **Politics**: ministries retain control of their own information. Instead of adding a centralized umbrella web portal and the perception of a shift in data ownership, a government adds a free tool into existing workflows. 
2. **Freshness**: the data in the ecosystem is always flowing from the source and is as new as the ministry is able to release.

### 2. Open Participatory Mapping Data
Building better exposure data is very time intensive, but it need not be costly. It requires individuals to visit thousands of municipal buildings and locations of critical infrastructure, make a basic assessment about the construction of those sites, take pictures, and ask locals questions about the site. If performed by survey departments of the government or commercial ventures, the costs quickly spiral beyond the means of most governments and donors. In comparison, mapping Kathmandu under OpenDRI cost under $200,000 USD. 

The approach taken by OpenDRI is to recruit and train community members to map their own cities. This method creates jobs for youth, trains them in modern geospatial tools, and prepares them for additional work curating the map of their cities. See [OpenCities](http://opencitiesproject.com/). It also creates a map that is free and open for all to use for any purpose.

#### OpenStreetMap
OpenStreetMap aims to create a free and open map of the world. Akin to Wikipedia, it allows anyone to draw on "the map" using a wide range of software and devices, including handheld computers and smartphones. To ensure accuracy and data quality, the OpenStreetMap Foundation works with communities in each country to encourage editors and experienced uses to review submissions, and provides software that makes it relatively easy for experienced users to correct the errors of person who has made a mistake or submitted inaccurate data. It is a community managed map.

While some might expect that the accuracy of the map would therefore be far lower than professional cartography, academic studies show that the map is within the margin of error of consumer GPS devices (see Muki Hakley, University College, London in this [discussion of the accuracy and reliability of volunteered geographic information](osm.html))

## Principles

### Start small and scale
The value of a network is a function of the square of the nodes in the network--a function of the number of potential relationships. Similarly, the value of open data appears to be an exponential function of the number of people using it. Open data efforts tend to start small and scale exponentially. Indonesia. From a few thousand buildings mapped by x people to million buildings with y contributors.

## Principles and Lessons Learned
1. Start with local needs. The project will flow from requirements driven by the client, rather than the needs of the risk modelers or international institution.

2. Incubate Local Capacity. Create a space where citizens of the client nation can develop ever deeper capabilities. 

3. Keep it simple, then scale. Agile development meets open data. 

4. Question Assumptions. The underlying assumptions of an international are often different than the reality on the ground. Don't assume that client wants to perform advanced risk modeling when they lack a 0 level base layer.

## Recommendation Option: Combine Open Government Data with Collective Action from Community Mapping, Hazard Modeling, and Risk Communication

Problem: how to aggregate information about a rapidly changing built environment amid a rapidly changing set of hazards. Has been attempted to be done through traditional governance mechanisms: submission of data on an periodic (often annual or multi-annual) basis. This collection rate is hard to sustain for many governments, but it is not fast enough to deal with the scale of the problem. 

<div class="info-box image-right adapted width-250px">
<p>Coping with the rapid aggregation and analysis of data from hundreds or thousands of potential sources is a problem that society already solved: stock market data. Investing or divesting from any particular form of equity is driven by the history and expected value of a stock price. The value of this price is driven by transaction of informed buyers and sellers. </p>

<p>A market is not the solution to risk data--it is not structured as a price driven by supply and demand. Rather, the mechanism of collective information aggregation is. Allow government to regulate how information flows, who is authorized to access and use it, and freeing some of the information for redistribution and reuse.</p> 

<p>(contact Tom Malone of MIT/CCI: here we have information aggregation mechanism from many sources which retain curation rights over their own data, but the value only derives from aggregation and analysis of the data. Decisions about what actions to take based on the data remain that of individual actors; coordination only generally happens in an emergency or preparation for an emergency. Conflict resolution does not yet exist, beyond maps, which is a wiki model). </p>
</div>
Combining top-down and bottom-up. Release government information that allows all actors to coordinate their assessments and mitigation activities around risks, and allow communities to curate the map of their own buildings' exposure to threats from natural hazards. 

The OpenDRI engagement packages three activities into the work plan:

1. Open Government Risk Data
2. Open Community Mapping Data
3. Open Risk Impact Models (Risk Communication)

(Note: This section needs to be a hard-nosed discussion of why to pursue open data as the best option. Not about ideals, but about the practical nature of open data being the best pathway to cope with the problem of risk assessment in a highly dynamic and less predictable world. This section should be about collective intelligence. )



## 3. Impact Models

To change the mindset of planners at all levels of government, it is not only necessary to give them maps and open up government data; they must also have simple tools that allow them to visualize potential futures. Because traditional risk assessment models require a great deal of training and expertise, a range of partners came together to build impact modeling tools that enable a municipal government official to pull hazard data from the national open risk data catalogue, exposure data about her city from OpenStreetMap, and with a few mouse clicks, show the potential impact of a hazard on the schools in her city.

[note: put all info on the connection of risk communication/impact models here in the intro. Key points: need to plan the interface between the data cycle and risk assessment cycle, with a point of interface around the data. In this connection, planning the data schema matters, as the impact models/InaSAFE requires some data from both government (hazard and vulnerability) combined with exposure data to calculate the potential impact. ]

### InaSAFE
Impact models are the brainchild of the partnership between the Government of Indonesia, AIFDR, AusAID, and the World Bank/GFDRR. (history to be continued).
