# 4.	Design
Building the capacity to perform probabilistic risk modeling (PRM) often starts from building the data necessary to support analytical work. The OpenDRI design phase explores how to create an iterative process of building up data from the top-down and bottom-up, while simultaneously teaching the client what new analytical techniques are possible when data from multiple layers are fused into a risk model.
  
An OpenDRI engagement will generally have three parts: open risk data, open mapping, and impact modeling. Each requires its own work plan. 


***

## 1. Open Government Risk Data
The design for OGRD will center on the collation, cleansing, and release of fragmented datasets via one or more data catalogues, usually GeoNodes. 

### Early Adopters
Based on the scoping mission, the team will have a map of the champions, allies, skeptics, and gatekeepers for data related to the DRM cycle. It is the early adopters who will function as champions. In general, they will have a problem that can only be solved by aggregating data. It is this use case which will likely form the core of the initial pilot. 

### Data Catalogue Design
In order to collect data across ministries that deal with hazards, exposure, vulnerabilities, and risks (HEVR)

#### Planning Data Catalogue Architecture

#### Resources
* [Worldbank LAC | AusAID | AIFDR InaSAFE Guides](http://worldbank)
* [US Open Data Policy Implementation Guide ](http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/)
* [US Open Data Policy Metadata Schema ](http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/)

### Collation of Data
OpenDRI cannot solve all data sharing problems. It focuses on the issues around the DRM cycle and the datasets that support decision makers around risk assessment, mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery, and reconstruction. The collation of data should center on a) data necessary for solving the use case(s) of early adopters, and b) the data sets that ministries are already prepared to release (low-hanging fruit). 

#### Resources
* TBD, To ask MapAction, OCHA.

### Cleansing of Data
Data that arrives from ministries may not always be ready for release. There may need to be work cleansing the data.

#### Resources
* USAID DCA Crowdsourcing Case Study on Data Cleansing

### Open Risk Data Advisory Working Group (ORDAWG)


### Writing the Concept Note

## 2. Open Participatory Mapping Data

### Identifying the Government Sponsor
Who is the early adopter?

### Planning Field Data Collection
What data need to be collected to drive which specific analytical problem? What other data could be collected alongside these data, without overburdening the system? Working with the cross support of risk modelers, compare data models recommended by this design process with the models from previous OpenDRI engagements.

### Finding the Incubator/Logistics Company
Who will host the meetings, purchase and maintain equipment, and train volunteers? Will this be one entity or a partnership of multiple entities (e.g., HOT + techspace)

### Writing the Concept Note
The concept note for Open Participatory mapping data TBD.

***

## 3. Risk/Impact Modeling
The process to design risk/impact modeling programs has thus far been bespoke. That said, there are a number of core elements that get put together into the designs:

### Science Organization Partnerships
Most OpenDRI risk/impact modeling efforts involve one or more science organizations: Geoscience Australia, JRC, 

### Software Development on Impact models
Who will build the extensions to the models that ministries request?

### Hazard Modeling Coordination
Where will the hazard data web services flow from?

### Ministry coordination
Which ministries are the early adopters for impact modeling? Are their provincial/municipal governments which also wish to use impact modeling? Who will train?

### Writing the Concept Note
Concept note format for Risk/Impact Modeling TBD.

## Objective




### Partners
What local partners and ministries will contribute?



### Incubation
Is there a local incubator and tech community to support the project

### Sustainability
What is the strategy for long-term sustainability

### Data
Do partners have data that can be made open?

## Team
Multi-disciplinary, Multi-Institutional (MDMI) team. Risk modelers, community mappers, government officials, CSOs, universities, international organizations engage in process to design the effort. AIFDR model.
