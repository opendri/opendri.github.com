# 4.	Design
Building the capacity to perform probabilistic risk modeling (PRM) often starts from building the data necessary to support analytical work. The OpenDRI design phase explores how to create an iterative process of building up data from the top-down and bottom-up, while simultaneously teaching the client what new analytical techniques are possible when data from multiple layers are fused into a risk model.

## Objective

### Partners
What local partners and ministries will contribute?

### Multi-disciplinary, Multi-Disciplinary (MD2) design
Risk modelers, community mappers, government officials, CSOs, universities, international organizations engage in process to design the effort. AIFDR model. 

### Incubation
Is there a local incubator and tech community to support the project

### Sustainability
What is the strategy for long-term sustainability

### Data
Do partners have data that can be made open?

## Team
Multidisciplinary.
